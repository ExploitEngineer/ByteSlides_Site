🎨 Features
🔄 Swiper.js Integration
This project uses Swiper.js to create sleek and smooth slides. Here’s how it’s implemented:

Swiper Initialization:
The Swiper instance is initialized in the swiper.js file, where you can adjust the configuration options like slide speed, navigation arrows, etc.
```bash
var swiper = new Swiper('.swiper-container', {
  direction: 'horizontal',
  loop: true,
  autoplay: {
    delay: 2500,
    disableOnInteraction: false,
  },
  navigation: {
    nextEl: '.swiper-button-next',
    prevEl: '.swiper-button-prev',
  },
  pagination: {
    el: '.swiper-pagination',
    clickable: true,
  },
});
```

Custom Styles:
The project includes custom CSS in styles.css that adjusts the appearance of Swiper slides, making them responsive and visually appealing.
📱 Responsive Design
This project is fully responsive, leveraging the power of Bootstrap’s grid system. The layout automatically adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring a smooth experience on both mobile and desktop.

Key responsive features:

Mobile-first layout: The design is optimized for smaller screens, then scaled up for larger ones.
Flexible navigation: The navigation bar collapses into a hamburger menu on mobile devices.
Grid system: The content is divided into rows and columns, adjusting according to the viewport width.
💡 Customization Options
Theme Colors:
You can change the theme of the project by editing the CSS in styles.css. Modify the color variables or add your own custom styles.

Font Settings:
Fonts are defined using Bootstrap’s utility classes. If you want to customize the fonts, you can adjust the font-family in the custom CSS file.

Swiper.js Customization:
You can change the Swiper configuration (e.g., adding new slides, enabling loop mode, adjusting autoplay speed) in the swiper.js file.

🧩 Custom Components
⚙️ Navbar
The navbar is built using Bootstrap’s navbar component and includes responsive toggling for mobile screens. It contains:

Links to navigate to various sections of the website.
A collapsible menu for smaller screen sizes.

```bash
<nav class="navbar navbar-expand-lg navbar-light bg-light">
  <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">BySlides</a>
  <button class="navbar-toggler" type="button" data-bs-toggle="collapse" data-bs-target="#navbarNav" aria-controls="navbarNav" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="Toggle navigation">
    <span class="navbar-toggler-icon"></span>
  </button>
  <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="navbarNav">
    <ul class="navbar-nav">
      <li class="nav-item active">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Home</a>
      </li>
      <li class="nav-item">
        <a class="nav-link" href="#">Features</a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
</nav>
```

🖼 Image Carousel
The homepage includes an image carousel built with Swiper.js for displaying multiple images in an interactive and smooth sliding manner.

```bash
<div class="swiper-container">
  <div class="swiper-wrapper">
    <div class="swiper-slide"><img src="assets/images/image1.jpg" alt="Image 1" /></div>
    <div class="swiper-slide"><img src="assets/images/image2.jpg" alt="Image 2" /></div>
    <div class="swiper-slide"><img src="assets/images/image3.jpg" alt="Image 3" /></div>
  </div>
  <div class="swiper-pagination"></div>
  <div class="swiper-button-next"></div>
  <div class="swiper-button-prev"></div>
</div>
```

⚙️ Scripts
The scripts.js file includes all the necessary scripts for interactive features, such as the Swiper initialization and other dynamic components.

```bash
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function() {
  // Initialize Swiper.js
  var swiper = new Swiper('.swiper-container', {
    loop: true,
    autoplay: {
      delay: 3000,
    },
  });
});
```

🔧 Troubleshooting
Swiper Not Working:
Ensure that you’ve correctly initialized Swiper.js and linked all the necessary scripts and styles in the HTML file.

Responsive Issues:
Check your CSS for any fixed widths or heights that may prevent the design from adapting to smaller screens. Use Bootstrap’s grid system to ensure fluid layouts.
