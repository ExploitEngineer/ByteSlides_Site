## 💻 Installation

To get BySlides up and running on your local machine, follow the steps below:

🚀 Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following installed:

- Node.js: You can download it from nodejs.org.
- npm (Node Package Manager) This comes with Node.js, so if you have Node.js installed, you’re good to go!

🛠️ Steps to Install

- Clone the Repository

First, clone the BySlides repository to your local machine by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DSnake0/ByteSlides_Site.git
```

- Navigate to the Project Directory

Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd ByteSlides_Site
```

- Install Dependencies

Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies required to run the website:

```bash
npm install
```
This will install all the dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.


- Run the Project Locally

Once the dependencies are installed, start the local development server by running:

```bash
npm run start
```
The website will now be accessible at http://localhost:3000 (or a different port if specified in your configuration).


🌍 Access the Project
After following the steps above, you can now open the website in your browser and view it locally.

🧪 For Production Deployment
If you want to deploy the project to a live server, you can use the following command to create a production-ready build:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate the optimized files in the `build` folder, which can be uploaded to your server or hosting platform.

.

💡 Troubleshooting

- If you encounter any issues during installation, make sure that your Node.js and npm versions are up to date.
- If the website doesn’t display as expected, check the browser’s developer tools for any errors in the console.
